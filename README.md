# URL Shortener Project

- A url shortener project that is built with microservices architecture but was not put together in a single repo.
- This repo is the core of the business logic of the project.
- The rest of the architecture also can be found throughout my github profile. You can take a look at the replica_set.yaml to the see whole picture.

- This project will be refactored so that whole different modules should be reached under the same repository!.
